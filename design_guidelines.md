I'd be happy to analyze your app's code and UI! Please go ahead and share:

1. **Code files** - Frontend components, styles, or any relevant implementation
2. **Screenshots or live URL** - So I can see the current UI state
3. **Any existing design decisions** - Color schemes, typography, component patterns you're already using
4. **Context** - What type of app is it? What's its primary purpose and target users?

Once you share these materials, I'll:
- Review the current implementation for consistency and best practices
- Identify any UI/UX improvements
- Provide specific design guidelines that align with what you've already built
- Help establish a cohesive design system to guide future development

Please attach or paste whatever you'd like me to review!
